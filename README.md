# "JetXoom" Autonomous AI Car
Goal: Train a fully autonomous, AI-powered JetRacer style project built on NVIDIA Jetson Nano using the JetCard image. This project includes model training for self-driving behavior, real-time control, and a custom-built **fault detection module** to monitor sensor and hardware reliability. Designed as a personal summer project and portfolio piece for internship applications.

## Project Goals
- Build and configure an AI car from the ground up.
- Train a deep learning model to autonomously navigate tracks and obstacles.
- Integrate real-time sensor fault detection.
- Demonstrate full autonomy with smooth line-following and recovery behavior.
- Document the process for showcasing in my portfolio and resume.


## Hardware
- NVIDIA Jetson Nano (4GB)
- 2200mAh 3S LiPo battery
- Motor driver (L298N)
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- IMU (MPU6050)
- Pi Camera Module V2
- Wi-Fi dongle
- Acrylic chassis 
- Wheels and motors
